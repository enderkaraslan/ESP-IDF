# Gpio Library

This repository contains a simple C++ library for handling GPIO operations on embedded systems. The library provides an object-oriented approach for controlling GPIO pins as inputs and outputs using the ESP32 platform.

## Features

- **GPIO Output Control**: Allows setting the state (HIGH/LOW) of GPIO pins and toggling their state.
- **GPIO Input Handling**: Reads the state of GPIO pins (HIGH/LOW) and allows for basic input operations.
- **Inverted Logic**: Supports inverted logic for GPIO operations, making it flexible for various hardware configurations.

## Requirements

- ESP32 or compatible microcontroller
- ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework)
- C++11 or later

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpio-library.git
